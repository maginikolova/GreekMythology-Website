<br><h3><a name="aphrodite">Aphrodite</h3></a>
Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes,
who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near
the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus\' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had
affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war.

<br><h3><a name="hades">Hades</h3></a>
Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. Hades means “The Unseen One” – a suitable name since Hades is
the ruler of the invisible world.In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it.
Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct Demeter’s daughter, Persephone.

<br><h3><a name="poseidon">Poseidon</h3></a>
Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. Poseidon’s name is very old, and its meaning is lost to us. One of the Twelve Olympians, he was
also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and
men, most famously with Athena and Odysseus.

<br><h3><a name="zeus">Zeus</h3></a>

<h3><a name="athena">Athena</h3></a>
Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically –
associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact,
even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked her for help and advice. Athena’s name is closely linked with the name of the city of Athens. The Ancient
Greeks debated whether she got her name after the city or the other way around. Modern scholars usually agree that the former was the case.
